## Safwan‚Äôs Odyssey Devlog: 3 [THE END AND RELEASE DAY]



Its all coming to an end. Safwan‚Äôs Odyssey started in late September based on a true story of Safwan breaking his glasses. The script was written in less then an hour with minor changes throughout production. Read on to see when it will be released
Animation

animation started soon after in the studios favorite software Blender, animation was the longest thing to finish. The first thing was character design some wanted the show to have an anime style others wanted a proper 3D rig either would have taken to long and made my anxiety the best thing to happen to me so we opted with a crap looking character that only has basic movement from the joint there is not rig just basic parenting inside of blender. The whole character moves up or down based on the syllables of the audio, we would have made this procedural but that would have took too much work so we just manually animated it using the auto key-er. 2D animation started in November and finished in early December by Suraj the newest member to the team
Rendering

Rendering was the easy thing but slowed down production. Each frame took about 3 seconds each using the evee render engine. Evee does not a ray traced rendered so we saved so much time on it. As I only have one computer when it was rendering I couldn‚Äôt do anything else as my CPU was pegged at 100% (A procrastinators dream).
Editing

Editing videos is the most fun thing (For me at least) this didnt really take much time comared to Animation about 2-3 weeks. We chose Sony Vegas as the editing software as we has not seen any crashes using it with boi news and any crashes in general will hurt me not only emotionally but physically. Rendering times in SV are sooooo quick the fastest we have ever seen and mind you we have used the whole 9 yards from adobe premiere, KDenlive, Olive, Final Cut Pro X and Hitfilm Express non of them can compare to SV in features and just how it just plainly works.
Trailer

After most of the Editing was done we made the first trailer (there was only one trailer)

This made the production quality rise ten fold and made me think that maybe this wasn‚Äôt a big waste of time, it was‚Ä¶ but it made me feel good. 84 FRICKING VIEWS WOW, IN LESS THEN A WEEK IF THE ACTUAL VIDEO DOESN‚ÄôT GET THAT I WILL CRY!!!
