## Safwans Odyssey Devlog: 1



Sadly I didn’t make dev logs at the start but now I thought it would be cool to do it, it makes me think that it looks more professional even though the whole thing is a waste of time.
## Finishing off Animation And The Next Stage

I have nearly finished all the scene that i have to animate the only scene left is the fight scene. This is the most technically difficult scene as I have to choreograph the fight. Ive been watching some Anime sooo I can just steal moves from them I think. We have hired a part-time 2D animator for this one scene.
### Video Editing

Video Editing is my pride and joy, its the first thing I have ever done on computers. Editing will bring this show together, but we have dilemer of what editor to use. My first choise was KDenlive but its very jAnK and crashes on me and has many rendering issues, Second was to go with one of my favourite Sony Vegas I found some crack somewere its timeline scrubbing is smooth but its only for windows and I can’t really get it working on my linux distro of choise Ubuntu.
## File Management

Something I prided my self from the beginning was how I kept all the scenes organised and easy to find.
